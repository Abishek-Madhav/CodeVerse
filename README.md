  # **Code-Verse** 👨🏻‍💻

## Problem statement ❔
Tracking and managing coding progress across multiple competitive programming platforms is fragmented and inefficient, lacking a unified view for users to monitor their growth.


## **Proposed Solution** 💡

Code-Verse provides a unified web dashboard that automatically tracks, aggregates, and visualizes a user's coding progress by integrating APIs and web scraping from platforms like Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, and GeeksforGeeks—offering a centralized and seamless experience for multi-platform progress monitoring.
